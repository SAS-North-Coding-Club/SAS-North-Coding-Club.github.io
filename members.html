      <h2>Rachel Farinas</h2>
      <p>I created the coding division within the Math and Coding Club, which I'm very active in. While I'm currently invested 
      in learning HTML, CSS, and Python, my old passions are writing, reading, and art. I'm majoring in computer science and I love animals! 
      I also love consuming all types of media, mainly political commentary and fictional novels.</p>

      <h2>Alejandro Santana</h2>
      <p> My name is Alejandro Santana and I'm a Biochemistry major. Apart from Science and math, I am particualrly interested in art, its history, and, of course, making it! With these interests in mind, I joined the coding club because I saw it as an incredible opportunity to further my current interests through coding and other projects, as well as, allow me to explore a whole new world!</p>

      <h2>Pascale Michaud</h2>
      <p>Hello!<br>I enjoy learning about sociology and philosophy. I love learning about what makes up human society and thinking about big questions from centuries ago. 
      I also love reading fictional books, mainly science fiction, fantasy and supernatural. If you guys know any good book series, put me on! I've been interested 
      in coding for a while now, but I never knew where to start. I think the club is a good introduction to the world of computer languages. If I end up liking coding more than 
      I expected, I might branch out and continue learning on my own. I might even get a minor related to coding. I'm thinking about majoring in chemical engineering or mechanical 
      engineering. I want to go to a university in Massachusetts.</p>

      <h2>Akilah Cunningham</h2>
      <p>Hi. I am still undecided about my major but I am considering majoring in Biology or Medicine. In my spare time I like to read, cook, bake, and listen to music.
      I joined this club becuase I wanted to learn more about coding and it seemed interesting.

      <h2>David Lopez</h2>
      <p>Hello guys! My love for video games motivated me to be a computer science major and I love coding though I don't have much experience in it, so I joined the club in hopes of knowing more and 
      preparing myself for the future.
