      <h2>Rachel Farinas</h2>
      <p>I created the coding division within the Math and Coding Club, which I'm very active in. While I'm currently invested 
      in learning HTML, CSS, and Python, my old passions are writing, reading, and art. I'm majoring in computer science and I love animals! 
      I also love consuming all types of media, mainly political commentary and fictional novels.</p>
