<br>

This is the code for the SAS North Math and Coding Club website,
created by the coding members.

Before you begin working on the code, please download ```Github Desktop```.
This is where we'll commit changes made by different members so we can
combine our work. By now, you should have downloaded ``Atom``, which is the
editor we'll be using to edit our website's code.

<br>

_Here's some terminology you might be unfamiliar with:_

<br>

***Source code*** is a list of commands, or code, compiled to create an
executable program.

<br>

A ***Git*** is a system that keeps tracks of the different versions of
source code allows collaborators to coordinate their work.

<br>

***Open source*** code is publicly accessible code. There are many
websites that have projects with open source code available for everyone to
view and replicate for their own learning purposes.

<br>

***Github*** is a corporation that uses ```Git``` and hosts source code. We'll
be using ```Github``` to keep track of all the versions of our website's
source code as we work on it. There are also many useful open source projects
on ```Github``` that we'll be using to improve our own code.

<br>

A ***Repository*** is a directory for a project. All of that project's files
are stored in the repository. It's like a folder of sorts.

<br>

A repository's ***main branch*** is the official working version of the code.
All of the project's final changes eventually will get saved to the main
branch, but not without being foolproof. You should always create a new
branch separate from the main one in order to edit the code. This ensures
that the final version is as perfect as possible.

<br>

***Pull requests*** are requests to commit changes to the main branch. Once again,
these changes should be clean and debugged. Please coordinate with other
members to ensure that this is the case before you enter a request.

<br>

***Committing*** is when you submit a changed version of the source code to one
of the repository's branches.

<br>

***⌘*** is the equivalent of the Windows key on PC. This is the symbol for
"command" on Mac.
